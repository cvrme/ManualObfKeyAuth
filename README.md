# Manually Obfuscated KeyAuth
Manually obfuscated key authenticator. Some values hardcoded, others protected. Encrypted throughout with ASCII and junk code to confuse the mind of a reverse engineer.
I do NOT recommend using this as a full-fledged KeyAuth unless you know what you are doing and can expand on it substantially. FYI: If you type the wrong key, the program will spam "NO" for about a minute unless closed. This can be changed of course, I was just having fun.

Thank you for checking out my work.
