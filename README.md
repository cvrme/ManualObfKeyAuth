# Manually Obfuscated KeyAuth
Manually obfuscated key authenticator. Some values hardcoded, others protected. Encrypted throughout with ASCII and junk code to confuse the mind of a reverse engineer.
I do NOT recommend using this as a full-fledged KeyAuth unless you know what you are doing and can expand on it substantially.

Thank you for checking out my work.
